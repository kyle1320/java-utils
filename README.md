Java Utils
==============

Java Utility functions, objects, and data structures
--------------

These are various "utility" classes I've written for use in my projects.

I wrote most of these back in high school, so there is likely some pretty bad code here and there.

Some of the classes here include:
  * General utility functions for reading input, generating random values, etc.
  * Functions for sorting, searching, etc. through arrays and collections
  * Functions for dealing with numbers, including ranges, min / max, averages, etc.
  * A simple expression compiler that compiles code to a java class that can then be used
  * A few linked list implementations (doubly linked list, stack, queue, etc.)
  * "Shapes" - methods for dealing with lines, circles, and generic convex polygons.
  * "Properties" - methods for dealing with properties that rely on other changing properties
  * "Grids" - methods for dealing with a 2D grid of generic objects, including displaying and changing them in customizable ways
  * And more!
